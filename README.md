# CVE Dorker

This script searches for CVEs related to JavaScript files and takes screenshots of the search results on Google.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running:

   $pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Run the script with the following command:
   
  $ python search-cve.py -f <path_to_js_files_text_file> -od <output_directory>

Replace `<path_to_js_files_text_file>` with the path to the text file containing JavaScript file paths, and `<output_directory>` with the directory where you want to save the screenshots.



## Credits

This script was made using the assistance of ChatGPT. The idea for the script was provided by Mathew Vincent.
